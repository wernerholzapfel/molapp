## Auth0 - Ionic 2 Login

This sample demonstrates how to add authentication to an Ionic 2 application using Auth0.

## Installation

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Set Auth0 Variable

Rename the `auth0-variables.ts.example` file to `auth0-variables.ts` and populate it with your application's  Auth0 client ID and domain.

## Add the `InAppBrowser` Plugin

You must install the `InAppBrowser` plugin from Cordova to be able to show the Login popup. The seed project already has this plugin added, but if you are adding Auth0 to your own application you need to run the following command:

```bash
ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-inappbrowser
```

and then add the following configuration to the `config.xml` file:

```xml
<feature name="InAppBrowser">
  <param name="ios-package" value="CDVInAppBrowser" />
  <param name="android-package" value="org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser.InAppBrowser" />
</feature>
```

## Run the Application

To serve the applicaton in the browser, use `ionic serve`.

```bash
ionic serve
```

To emulate the application, use `ionic emulate`. You may optionally choose a target device for the platform you are using.

```bash
ionic emulate ios --target="iPhone-6"
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
